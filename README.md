つな〜みh or The Stop Using Notes App App: Making Ideas Happen is a personalized application that allows users to bookmark links with notes. Programmers can save YouTube videos and jot down timestamps. Musicians can save music videos of songs they might want to learn later. Users will create an account and start saving posts. Because of the lack of the app's limitations, the possibilities are endless!
​
The application utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Sequelize, Handlebars, and Passport.  Passport a technology that allows us to give the end users accounts that personalize the rendered products.
